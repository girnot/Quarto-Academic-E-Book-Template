    2020s : Modern Era
         : Current best practices
```

## Section 2: Your First Example

Let's see these concepts in action with a simple example.

### Example 1.1: Hello World

Every journey begins with a first step. Here's your first code example:

```python
def greet(name):
    """
    A simple greeting function.

    Args:
        name (str): The name to greet

    Returns:
        str: A personalized greeting message
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the course."

# Try it out
message = greet("Student")
print(message)
```

**Output**:
```
Hello, Student! Welcome to the course.
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Try It Yourself

1. Copy this code to your Python environment
2. Run it with different names
3. Modify the greeting message
4. Add error handling for empty names
:::

### Example 1.2: Working with Data

Let's expand with a more practical example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(x, y, color='#1a5f7a', linewidth=2, label='sin(x)')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Sample Data Visualization')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This produces a simple sine wave visualization, demonstrating basic plotting capabilities.

### Case Study: Simple Problem

**Problem**: We need to analyze a dataset and identify patterns.

**Approach**:
1. Load the data
2. Clean and prepare
3. Analyze patterns
4. Visualize results

```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Common Pitfall

**Don't skip data cleaning!** Many beginners jump straight to analysis, but cleaning is often 80% of the work.

Always:
- Check for missing values
- Validate data types
- Remove duplicates
- Handle outliers appropriately

## Practice Problems

Apply what you've learned with these exercises.

### Problem 1: Modify the Greeting ⭐

**Difficulty**: Beginner

Modify the `greet()` function to:
- Accept optional time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Return appropriate greeting based on time
- Handle missing or invalid inputs gracefully

**Example**:
```python
greet("Alice", "morning")  # "Good morning, Alice!"
greet("Bob", "evening")    # "Good evening, Bob!"
greet("Charlie")           # "Hello, Charlie!"
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Solution

```python
def greet(name, time_of_day=None):
    """
    Generate a time-appropriate greeting.

    Args:
        name (str): Person to greet
        time_of_day (str, optional): 'morning', 'afternoon', or 'evening'

    Returns:
        str: Formatted greeting
    """
    if not name:
        return "Hello there!"

    greetings = {
        'morning': f"Good morning, {name}!",
        'afternoon': f"Good afternoon, {name}!",
        'evening': f"Good evening, {name}!"
    }

    return greetings.get(time_of_day, f"Hello, {name}!")

# Test
print(greet("Alice", "morning"))
print(greet("Bob", "evening"))
print(greet("Charlie"))
```
:::

### Problem 2: Data Analysis ⭐⭐

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

Create a function that:
1. Generates random sample data
2. Calculates basic statistics (mean, median, std)
3. Creates a visualization
4. Returns a summary dictionary

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Solution

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def analyze_data(size=100, distribution='normal'):
    """Analyze sample data and visualize results."""
    # Generate data
    if distribution == 'normal':
        data = np.random.normal(0, 1, size)
    else:
        data = np.random.uniform(-2, 2, size)

    # Calculate statistics
    stats = {
        'mean': np.mean(data),
        'median': np.median(data),
        'std': np.std(data),
        'min': np.min(data),
        'max': np.max(data)
    }

    # Visualize
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    plt.hist(data, bins=20, color='#1a5f7a', alpha=0.7, edgecolor='black')
    plt.axvline(stats['mean'], color='#f26b60', linestyle='--',
                linewidth=2, label=f"Mean: {stats['mean']:.2f}")
    plt.xlabel('Value')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.title(f'{distribution.capitalize()} Distribution (n={size})')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

    return stats

# Test
results = analyze_data(size=1000)
print("Statistics:", results)
```
