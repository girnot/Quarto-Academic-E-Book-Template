## Part 1: [First Major Task]

### Step 1.1: [Specific Task]

[Clear instructions on what to do]

**What you'll do**:
- Action 1
- Action 2
- Action 3

**Code to implement**:

```python
# Starter code with TODO comments
def function_name(parameter):
    """
    Description of what this function should do.

    Args:
        parameter: Description

    Returns:
        Description
    """
    # TODO: Implement this function
    pass

# Test your implementation
result = function_name(test_input)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Hints

- **Hint 1**: Specific guidance
- **Hint 2**: Another helpful tip
- **Hint 3**: Common approach to try
:::

### Step 1.2: [Next Task]

[Instructions for next step]

```python
# Continue implementation
# More code here
```

### ✅ Checkpoint 1

Before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] Output matches expected result
- [ ] No error messages
- [ ] Understanding what the code does

**Expected output**:
```
[Show what correct output should look like]
```

If you see errors, check:
1. [Common issue 1]
2. [Common issue 2]
3. See [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting)

---

## Part 2: [Second Major Task]

### Step 2.1: [Task Description]

[Instructions]

```python
# Implementation code
```

### Step 2.2: [Continued Task]

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Approach A
```python
# One way to solve
```

## Approach B
```python
# Alternative solution
```

## Comparison
Which approach is better for this scenario? Why?
:::

### ✅ Checkpoint 2

Verify your implementation:

```python
# Test cases
assert function(input1) == expected1, "Test 1 failed"
assert function(input2) == expected2, "Test 2 failed"
print("All tests passed! ✓")
```

---

## Part 3: [Final Task/Integration]

### Step 3.1: [Combining Components]

Now put everything together:

```python
# Complete implementation
def main():
    """Main function integrating all parts."""
    # Part 1 components
    result1 = part1_function()

    # Part 2 components
    result2 = part2_function(result1)

    # Final output
    display_results(result1, result2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 3.2: [Validation]

Test your complete implementation:

```python
# Comprehensive test
```

### ✅ Final Checkpoint

Your implementation should:

- [ ] Complete all required tasks
- [ ] Produce correct output
- [ ] Handle edge cases
- [ ] Be well-documented
- [ ] Follow coding standards
