# Laboratory Exercises {.unnumbered}

## Overview

The laboratory exercises provide hands-on experience with the concepts covered in the theory chapters. Each lab is designed to reinforce learning through practical implementation.

## Lab Structure

Every lab includes:

- **Clear objectives** aligned with course learning outcomes
- **Step-by-step instructions** with checkpoints
- **Starter code** to guide implementation
- **Test cases** to verify correctness
- **Optional challenges** for advanced learners
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues

## How to Use Labs

::: {.callout-tip}
## Lab Workflow

1. **Prepare**: Complete prerequisite chapters and setup
2. **Read**: Review entire lab before starting
3. **Implement**: Follow steps, test at checkpoints
4. **Verify**: Ensure all tests pass
5. **Challenge**: Try optional extensions
6. **Submit**: Follow submission guidelines

## Grading Criteria

All labs are evaluated on:

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Correctness** | 50% | Does it work as specified? |
| **Code Quality** | 20% | Clean, readable, documented |
| **Testing** | 15% | Proper test implementation |
| **Documentation** | 10% | Comments and explanations |
| **Submission** | 5% | On time, proper format |

## Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. **Check troubleshooting section** in the lab
2. **Review related chapter** for theory
3. **Test incrementally** to isolate issues
4. **Use office hours** for guidance
5. **Ask in discussion forum** for peer help
